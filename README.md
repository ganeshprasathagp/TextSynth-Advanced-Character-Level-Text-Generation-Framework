TextSynth: Advanced Character-Level Text Generation Framework

TextSynth is a sophisticated and versatile framework designed for generating text sequences that emulate the style and structure of your input data. By processing a text file where each line represents a unique training example, TextSynth learns intricate patterns and produces coherent, contextually relevant outputs. It functions as an autoregressive character-level language model, offering a range of architectures from simple bigrams to advanced models like Transformers.

Key Features:

Diverse Text Generation: Whether you're aiming to create unique names, innovative company titles, or coherent word formations, TextSynth adapts to various datasets to generate contextually appropriate text sequences.

Comprehensive Learning Tool: Designed with both simplicity and depth, TextSynth is encapsulated within a single, easily modifiable script. This design encourages experimentation and learning, making it an excellent resource for understanding the mechanics of language models.

Seamless PyTorch Integration: Leveraging the PyTorch library, TextSynth ensures efficient computation and provides a familiar framework for users acquainted with this popular deep learning toolkit.

Implemented Architectures:

TextSynth incorporates several foundational models, each inspired by seminal research in the field:

Bigram Model: Captures the probability of a character based on its immediate predecessor.

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): Utilizes recurrent connections to capture dependencies in sequences.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Addresses the vanishing gradient problem in RNNs, enabling the modeling of longer dependencies.

Transformer: Employs self-attention mechanisms for parallel processing of sequences, facilitating the modeling of complex patterns.

Getting Started:

Prepare Your Dataset: Create a text file where each line represents a distinct training example relevant to your desired output.

Configure the Model: Select the desired architecture and adjust hyperparameters within the script to suit your specific use case.

Train the Model: Run the script to initiate the training process. TextSynth will process the input data and learn the underlying patterns.

Generate Text: After training, use the model to generate new text sequences that mirror the style and structure of your input data.
